# DogShowProject

Callum Smith

## Introduction

This project was to be created based around a hobby or something of interest or anything with a particular business need. I went for the theme of dogs as mine happens to be my best-friend. However, I mixed this up to be a little creative and have essentially a list of 'Dog Show Contestants'. This was created with a CRUD applcation that included all aspects o our training to date - A Jira Board, MySQL and h2 databases, JavaScript & Spring Boot, a level of testing using MockMVC and a Front-End and Back-End Development.

### Planning

Starting of with the planning for this was used in the Jira Software creating a Kanban board modelled as a scrum. I created my epic, along with user stories. An example user story is shown below:

In total, I worked with 1 epic and 6 user stories. This was a very basic way to work around all the actions required to complete the project, however, I feel in this instance, it was easier for me to keep my plan as basic as possible - knowing my current knowledge throughout the course of the training, I did not want to have anything overcomplicated as I feel this would have majorly hindered my project and tested my cabilities to unknown extent.

Moving on from my Jira Board, I started the process in creating my Databases. I started with a local h2 database for testing the back-end.

I then, using Eclipse, integrated it work with the MySQL database.

### Testing

I created the back-end of this project using Java in a Spring Boot Application and performed my integration test:

### Front-End

Using Visual Studio Code, I then started preparing my Front-End. With the use of HTML and CSS files, I was able to structure a webpage design with different fonts, colours, backgrounds and images. However, this was something I had a fair bit difficulty with and struggled getting my functions working correctly. An example of the webpage is below:

The overall idea of this webpage was to be interactive with the user & allow any dog owners to add their own pet as a contestant, also with the ability to edit and delete their own record where applicable.
